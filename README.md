# random-forest-multi-class
random forest of neural networks to classify Spotify songs by mood

This was the central part of sem-6 group project for the course software-development lab.

A 10-ensemble of MLP trained on random 64% chunks of the training data to ensure a variety of opinion during labelling. Resulting labels are therefore conveniently smooth and receptive to grading data label-to-label, perfect for our project use case.
